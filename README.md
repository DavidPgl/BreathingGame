# Breathing Game

This is a prototype and showcase game.

A small game that uses a player's breath as a additional input. Uses an arduino that prints the temperature of the breath to the serial port (see: [ArduinoTemperature](https://github.com/DavidPgl/ArduinoTemperature))

## Game
As a thief the player has to collect all crystals/gems in the level and find the exit to proceed to the next level, while avoiding enemies. Enemies can be alerted by the soundwaves created by the breath of the player. 

### Controls
- A and D for movement
- W and SPACE for jumping
- E for interaction
- MOUSE2 (right click) for sending a soundwave (Used for debugging and when you don't have an arduino and a temperature sensor laying around :D)
